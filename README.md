# DataScience
With everyone being so confused about Data Science &amp; Data Analytics, we decided to write a Post that would explain how the field originated, the differences between the two and what you should be opting for.  Let's go back to 80s when everything was done using calculator and trial and error methods
t all changed as Microsoft Excel was introduced in 1985 & Business Analytics was born. Excel has been a great choice to have basic database management but the things were to change soon as smartphones & Internet came into the picture.

Can You guess how much data is being created each day?

It'sÂ 2.5 quintillion bytes each day as mentioned here.
Companies then began to realize that this huge data is a Gold Mine. Not only it can help them to understand things visually and make strategies, but they can build Models around this data to achieve automation. And every Big Company has realized that it may be the tool to use to beat competitions and stay a leader in their domain.

And if you are planning to be a part of this field, it becomes mandatory to understand the differences between the two and choose the career that suits you.

Also, it's quite possible that you may have your company or you are planning to start a one. Knowing the difference between the Job roles would allow you to recruit the right person to get the things done.

Layman Understanding
Let me clear up terms like data science, Big Data, Data Analytics & Data Science in the simplest possible manner before giving a bigger picture.

Data Science is a science or study of data.

Big Data is a theoretical concept for defining problems that arise because of the large size of data where traditional data handling tools are not capable enough.

Data Analytics is a bunch of tool and techniques to perform analysis of data (big and small).
